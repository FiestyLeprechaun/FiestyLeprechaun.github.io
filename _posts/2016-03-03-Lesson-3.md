In lesson 3 we learned about the advantages and disadvantages of social media. There are several advantages for example business you can put your company's name out there and get it well known and you are able to send someone a message from the other side of the planet, and you talk to someone face to face with a click of a button. This is helpful for many different reasons. But unfortunately there are many disadvantages such as, grooming prepare or train (someone) for a particular purpose or activity.(of a paedophile) prepare (a child) for a meeting, especially via an Internet chat room, with the intention of committing a sexual offence. Cyberbullying the use of electronic communication to bully a person, typically by sending messages of an intimidating or threatening the other person. I personally found this lesson very intriguing because it showed me what the effect of the stuff you do online can be.
