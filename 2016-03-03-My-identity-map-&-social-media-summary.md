It was really fun to create my identity map. I found sharing my map fine because I thought people will be nice. Commenting on the maps something I thought would be very useful to my classmates and me. I enjoyed this process and wouldn't change it. When I was actually reading the comments I was surprised at how much people repeated  each other's ideas I thought they would be able to come up with something new. It is different to commenting on someone online cause you don't think as much about there reaction. It helped me think about what want to post. The last six lesson did change my view on social media it showed me how much of a lie it can be.
