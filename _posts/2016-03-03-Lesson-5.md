The homework for lesson 4 was to create an identity map. In the lesson we had to go around writing comments. Creating my identity map was very helpful, because It helped me understand myself much more than I do. It also helped me realise that no one can change me. When we were commenting on the maps we didn't say who wrote what. Having done the lesson in this way kind of gave me a feel for what social media is like. It also ment that people didn't have to worry much about what they write. When I read your comments I found that most of the comments were the same I don't know whether or not it was because they thought the same things or that they were copying each others ideas. This project help me think about what I want to post when I get social media.
