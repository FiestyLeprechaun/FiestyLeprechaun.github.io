Lesson 1I learned that an advert is not always what it seems. A way of advertising your brand is by getting someone famous or important to show of your brand because it will make the person seeing this advertisement think if I have this I will be them. This is why brands make it big.After this lesson I will definitely think about what I buy before I actually buy it because I may be buying something i don't need.
