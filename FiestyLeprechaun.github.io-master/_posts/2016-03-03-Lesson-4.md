Lesson 4. Today we watched a video where there was a woman and she was just living the moment but everyone around her was on there phone. When the woman was out with her friends they started to talk but then got disinterested and went on social media. The video was trying to show us that we shouldn't be wasting our time on social media and sharing what we are doing but that we should actually enjoy the moment.After that we got in groups of three. We had to make up ten social media rules per group. These are my groups rules;

1: Know who you are speaking to and with.

2: Would either Dr. Fenton or your parents want to see what you have posted or texted.

3: Think before you post.

4: Use it to Catch up with important occasions.

5: If anything goes wrong don't be scared to say something.

6: Don't give away personal information.

7: Act as yourself and don't hide behind someone else.

8: Use it to have fun and enjoyment otherwise it will make you upset.

9: Ignore nasty comments because they will dishearten you.

10:Do not try and hurt people on purpose because that is bullying.

11: You can use it to talk and catch up with people you can't always meet.
