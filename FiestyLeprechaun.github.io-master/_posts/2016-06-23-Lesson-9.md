Lesson 9 at the beginning of the lesson we watch the beginning of Harry Potter where he puts on the sorting hat. We then tried ourselves to make the sorting hat on microbit using a tutorial we did this again without a tutorial on JavaScript then we tried to put our own houses in instead of the Hogwarts houses.
