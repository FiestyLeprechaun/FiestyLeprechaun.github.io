Lesson 7. Today we looked at a site called Prezi. Before that though we discussed what a presentation is and what a good and bad one is. A presentation is when you talk about a chosen subject. We then actually looked at what Prezi was it was a more exciting way to show someone something during your presentation. In the last bit of the lesson we got to mess around on Prezi .
